# Convert all VTT files of a directory to SRT 

## Intro:
The VTT files are used when you download the subtitules from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and several video players doesn't import this file. So i decided to automatize the conversion of this files to SRT ( standar to subtitles ) 

## Usage:
```
python vvt2srt.py videocourse
```

I hope this is your liking :+1:
